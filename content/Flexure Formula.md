# Flexure formula
#SM224
Relates the internal stresses in the cross of the beam to the bending moment.

## Assumptions
- Material is linear elstic
- Linear distribution of the normal strain leads to a linear distribution in normal stress (hooke's Law)
- the stress and strain os zero at the neutral axis and is max at c, shich is the furthest position from the neutral axis


## Stress distribution

Can use sign convention or logic to determine tension or compression

## In terms of Moment

So

The neutral axis coensides with the centre of gravity, so we can use \bar(y) to find NA and then C or \tho

setup shear and bending moment, diagram, so we can see max M. (- moment will cause region above NA tension and below NA will be in compression. + moment will cause compression above NA)

We can break moment into components and then

This expression has left out the signs as we use the logical approach for compression an d tension, but we can use the sign version if using sign convention.

1. For the "logical approach" break M into x and y components.
3. Then decide where max tension and max compression will occur.
4. Then take a that point where you think the max comp/tension is and work out the x and y stresses at that point.
5. If both are in compression/tension simply add them. Or if one is comp and other is tension, subtract them to find comp/tension at that point.
6. Do the same for the other point.
