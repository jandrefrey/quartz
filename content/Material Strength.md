title: "Material Strength"
---
A Material property given by $S$.

Brittle, Ductile, Toughness..
## Alloying Elements
Alloying elements are added to base metal (e.g. Cr, Mo, V, Al, Cu) to 
	- provide solid-solution strengthening 
	- improve corrosion resistance & other characteristics 
	- improve hardenability / phase stability 
- BUT can cause the precipitation of intermetallic phases.

For steels, refer to AISI grades, as well as [[iron-carbon phase diagram]]

## Heat Treatment
See [[iron-carbon phase diagram]]

- Cold Drawn – dislocation/strain hardening/strengthening
	- more expensive. 
	- Can be heat treated (to restore ductility), but lead to dimensional changes. 
- Hot Rolled – at recrystallisation temperature (retains ductility)
	- not for precision parts.
- Solution heat treatment (heating above recrystallisation temperature and quenching) – usually hardens the steel.
- Anneal/Temper: Heat to relatively low T. Cool under slow controlled conditions. Reduces hardness and improves machinability. Usually after quenching/working

>Severe Cold (i.e. Polar/Arctic) or High Temperature exposure (e.g. Jet turbines or Thermal Power plants) affect the microstructure; this can cause a ductile-brittle transition, thereby affecting the yield strength

Volume fractions at room temperature:
$$
g_\alpha^{R T}=\frac{C_s^{\text {eut }}-C_0}{C_S^{\text {eut }}-C_\alpha^{\text {eut }}} \quad g_{C M}^{R T}=\frac{C_0-C_s^{\text {eut }}}{C_{C M}^{\text {eut }}-C_S^{\text {eut }}}
$$
