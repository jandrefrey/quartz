title: "Zener Diode"
---
Designed to “break down” at low voltages. Useful for when a constant voltage is required in a circuit for a wide range of current values.
Breakdown Voltage given by:
$$V_Z=I_Zr_Z+V_{Z0}$$

- The slope is very steep since $r_z$ is usually small.
- The current must be limited in the circuit since large current are possible.
