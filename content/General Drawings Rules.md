# General Drawings Rules

## Freehand Sketches
Free-hand sketching assists the present-day engineer with the following:
- The detailing of parts for which there are no formal drawings. (Sketching without equipment in remote locations)
- The facilitation of the design process.
- The exchange of ideas and presentation of concepts.
- Layout planning in the case of complicated formal drawings.
- As a guide for the CAD draughtsman to follow.

The four steps to drawing three-dimensional (isometric) free-hand sketches:
- Step 1: The position and proportions of the object are determined. (Block shapes and centre lines before any curves)
- Step 2: Details are filled in with construction lines. (Circles - four arcs)
- Step 3: The outlines are filled in and darkened.
- Step 4: Construction lines are erased, or the object is traced onto a new sheet.
The quality of the sketch depends on the number of views, the end-user, available time, etc.

## Detail Drawing

- A detail drawing enables you to have a part correctly manufactured anywhere in the world.
- The design engineer’s responsibility is to ensure that the drawing is clear and unambiguous.
- Only one part per drawing, unlike in the past.
- The title block is always filled in. (Units, scale, material, notes, etc.)
- Scale 1:1 is generally used.
- A parts list appears on both detail and assembly drawings, above and adjacent to the title block.
- Parts list columns (Left to right):
	- Item Number.
	- Description (Name).
	- Quantity.
	- Material / Specifications.
- The Material / Specifications column in an assembly drawing contains either part or subassembly numbers, or bought-out part codes and details.
- No dimensions other than overall dimensions, or selected reference dimensions appear on an assembly drawing, and then only if requested by the client.
- Very important – please take note:
	- This course builds on the first year’s knowledge of Engineering Drawing 123.
	- You need to have an above-average understanding of 1st and 3rd angle orthographic projection, including sections, auxiliary views, and especially dimensioning principles according to SANS 10111-1 rules and the additional guidelines provided by the ‘Stellenbosch standards’ you were taught.
	-  There is no time in this course to revise any of the above information; it is entirely your responsibility to ensure that your knowledge of Engineering Drawing 123 meets the required standard.

## Sections
- A section ‘cuts through’ an object or assembly.
- It also shows the external detail around and behind the cutting plane.
- The cut surface is highlighted by means of hatching; type B lines (SANS 10111-1), 3mm – 6mm apart, at 45° with respect to the drawing sheet, unless another angle is preferable for clarity.
- Hidden detail is not shown on sections, except for centre lines.

- Types of sectional views (other than full sections):
	- Half section; it may or may not be indicated by section arrows.
	- Part section; no section arrows necessary.
	- Revolved section; no section arrows necessary.
	- Offset section.
	- Aligned section.

No two adjacent components are drawn with the same hatching in an assembly section, to distinguish individual components from one another.

- Some components or parts of components are not hatched in a part or assembly drawing:
	- Ribs in longitudinal section.
	- Standard fasteners such as bolts, nuts, studs, screws, rivets, washers, etc.
	- Shafts.
	- Pins.
	- Keys.
	- Cotters. (A cotter is a type of key)
	- Gibs. (A gib is also a type of key)
