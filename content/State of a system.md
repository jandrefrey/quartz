# State
Condition of a [[Systems]] described by its properties
A change in properties will thus cause a new state.

## Equilibrium
no unbalanced potentials
we can have thermal equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium, etc.

### Thermal equilibrium
Two bodies are in thermal equilibrium if they have the same [[temperature]] reading, even if they are not touching.
