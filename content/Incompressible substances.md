# Incompressible Substances
All liquid and solids are incompressible.
Specific volume (density) remains constant during any process, so [[Specific Heats]]:

> $c = c_p = c_v$

## [[Enthalpy]] changes
- $\Delta h = \Delta u  + c \Delta P = c_{avg} \Delta T + v\Delta P$
### Solids
$v\Delta P$ is 0, so:
- $\Delta h = c_{avg} \Delta T$

### Liquids
- Constant pressure [[Processes]]: $\Delta h = c_{avg} \Delta T$
- Constant temperature [[Processes]]: $\Delta h = v \Delta P$
