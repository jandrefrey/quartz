# Processes
Any change that a system undergoes from one equilibrium state to another.
These processes must satisfy [[First law of thermodynmics]] and [[Second law of thermodynamics]]

## Quasistatic or quasi-equilibrium process
When a process proceeds in such a manner that the syustem remains infinitesimally close to an equilibrium state at all times.

### Isothermal process
Temperature remains constant

### Isobaric process
Pressure remains constant ^7bb744

### Isochoric (isometric) process
specific volume remains constant

### Polytropic Process
$PV^n = C$

### Cycle
Initial and final states are indentical.

## Reversible and irreversible processes
### Reversible process
A process that can be reversed without leaving any trace on the surroundings. This is like the unreachable goal for all processes.
- They deliver the most and consumes the least work.
#### Internally Reversible processes
If no irreversibilities occur within the boundaries of the system during the process.
#### Externally reversible
If no irreversibilities occur outside the system boundaries.
#### Totally reversible process:
It involves no irreversibilities within the system or its surroundings. A totally reversible process involves no heat transfer through a finite temperature difference, no nonquasi-equilibrium changes, and no friction or other dissipative effects.

### Irreversible processes

^34a174

A process that is not reversible. All the processes occurring in nature are irreversible.
- Easier to analyse
- Serve as idealised models to which actual processes can be compared.
- Factors causing irreversable processes are called irreversibilities:
	- friction, unrestrained expansion, mixing of two fluids, heat transfer across a finite temperature difference, electric resistance, inelastic deformation of solids, and chemical reactions.

## Isentropic processes
Constant [[Entropy]] Processes
