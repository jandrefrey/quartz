title: "Difference of two means"
---
Confidence Interval:
$$\left(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\right) \pm t_{d f}^{\star} S E_{\left(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\right)}$$
Standard error of **difference between two independent means**:
$$
S E_{\left(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$
With Degreed of freedom:
$$d f=\min \left(n_1-1, n_2-1\right)$$

From here we can use a similar approach to [[t-distribution#Paired Data]]
