Determining a sample size to achieve 80% certainty. (80% power)

- Type I error is rejecting $\mathrm{H}_0$ when you shouldn't have, and the probability of doing so is $\alpha$ (significance level)
- Type 2 error is failing to reject $\mathrm{H}_0$ when you should have, and the probability of doing so is $\beta$.
- Power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting $\mathrm{H}_0$, and the probability of doing so is $1-\beta$
	- Thus to increase power, we need to decrease probability of type 2 error.
