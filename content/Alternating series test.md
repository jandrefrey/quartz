1. Write in Standard Form:
$$
\sum(-1)^{n-1} \cdot b_n
$$
2. Now focus on the $b_n$
3. Choose the next term $b_{n+1}$
4. Now determine whether $b_n$ is descending ($b_{n+1}<b_n$ ) (can also take derivative if it's difficult)
5. Determine the following limit:
	$$
\lim _{n=1 \rightarrow \infty} b_n
$$
6. ==If that limit is 0 AND $b_n$ is descending, then $a_n=$ CONVERGENT==
7. Otherwise $a_n=$ DIVERGENT
