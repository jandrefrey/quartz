A sample is a select group of the population group. When samples are chosen incorrectly, we will only have **anecdotal evidence.**

## Simple random sampling
when random samples are taken over the entire population group.
- Minimize bias.
- knowing that a case is included in a sample does not provide useful information about which other cases are included.

> Bias from a high non-response rate can skew results.
> Another downfall is a convenience sample, where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample.

## Stratified Sampling
dividing the population into groups called strata. Similar cases are grouper together. (Usually simple random sampling within each stratum)
- Stratified sampling is especially useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome of interest. 
- The downside is that analyzing data from a stratied sample is a more complex task than analyzing data from a simple random sample.

## Cluster Sampling
breaking up the population into clusters. Then a fixed number of clusters are sampled. **multistage sampling** involves selecting a random sample within each selected cluster.
- Relatively economical sampling method.
- most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves don't look very different from one another.
- more advanced techniques are typically required to analyse the data.
