- Know the following definitions and formulas: 
	- coefficients of the Taylor/ Maclaurin series of functions
	- table with important Maclaurin series (ignore the binomial series)
	- inner product
	- orthogonal
	- norm
	- Fourier series
	- Fourier cosine/sine series of a function (learn the formulas of the Fourier coefficients so you can compute them for any value of n, say, e.g. a2)
	- complex Fourier series of a function (learn the formula for the coefficients)
	- apply Theorem 12.2.1 in Zill to compute F at any real value x, all Fourier transforms (and their inverses) of functions and their first and second derivatives.
