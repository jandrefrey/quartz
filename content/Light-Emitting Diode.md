title: "Light-Emitting Diode"
---
Similar characteristics to [[The PN Junction]] diode.
- When forward-baised, depletion region narrows. Diffusion occurs.
- Electrons from the conduction band recombine with holes in the valence band.
- This recombination produces energy.
	- Holes are at a lower energy.
	- Excess energy must be released.
	- Direct bandgap semiconductors used.
- The spectral wavelength depends on the material and doping.
