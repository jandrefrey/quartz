# Vector Spaces
Vector space $V$ is a set of vectors. if $v \in  V$ then, $v$ is a vector of $V$. Together with $V$ is called a binary operation which is called "vector addition" and "scalar multiplication." 
A scalar is a set where you can add, subtract, multiply, divide and it all behaves as normal. (so like real numbers and complex numbers)
- Binary operation: Combines entities of the same kind, to produce entity of the same kind.

For any valid Vector space, the following axiums must hold:
1. For any $v, w \in V$, $v+w \in V$
2. For any $k \in R$ and any $v \in V$, $k \times v \in V$
3. For any $v, w \in V$ we have $v+w=w+v$ (commutative)
4. For any $v, w, z \in V$, we have $(v+w)+z = v+(w+v)$ (assosiative)
5. There exists $0 \in V$ , called the zero-vector, such that $x+0=x$ for any $x \in  V$
6. For any $v \in V$, there is a $-x \in V$ such that $x+(-x) = 0$
7. For any $k \in R$ and any $x, y \in V$, we have $k(x*y) = kx+ky$
8. For any $k_1, k_2, \in  R$ and any $x \in V$ $(k_1+k_2)*x = k_1x+k_2x$
9. For any $k_1, k_2 \in R$ and any $x \in V$ we have $k_1(k_2x)=(k_1k_2)x$
10. For any $x \in V$ we have $1x = x$

The span of v is a [[Subspaces]] of V
