# Turbines and Compressors
These are [[Steady flow process]]
- Turbine
	- Fluid passes through work doing on blades so ==work is carried out==
 - Compressor
	 - ==Work is carries in== via a shaft to ==increase pressure== of fluid

In General: (unless question states otherwise)
- $Q = 0$
- $\Delta V = 0$
- $\Delta KE = 0$
- $\Delta PE = 0$

So
