# Composites
Material is multiphase and is ==artificially made==
Combine material properties.

- can't run at extreme temps as metals and ceramics (bc of inclusion of polymers)
- Higher Strength as many other materials (not always ceramics)

- Multiphase: 
	- Matrix Phase: continuoys phase. Transfer stress to dispersed pahse, protect phase from environment, brarrier to crack propogation.
	- Dispersed phase: Discontinuous phase.
		- Metal-matrix composites: Increase strengths, TS, creep resist.
		- Ceramic_metal composits: Increase toughness ($K_{IC}$)
		- Polimer Matrix composites: Increase E, strength, TS, creep resist.

		 - why is sand needed in conrcrete?
			 - Conrete requires dense packing so sand is added to fill the gaps between the gravel.
		- why is concrete reinforced?
			- concrete 10x weaker in tension.

		- Fibers are anisotropic (dependant on direction)

		- Ff/Fm should greater than one, stronger fibers are carrying more of the load.

		- GIVEN GLASS-POLYESTER, carbon epoxy and kevlar epoxy, which would be best suited to cary a load in the transverse direction?
