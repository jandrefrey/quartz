where G is the [[centre of gravity]]
From here we can derive:

## Solving problems
1. Draw in forces
2. Take sum moments at P
	1. If we only have translation $\alpha$ will be 0, so we only have $ma_Gd$
3. Sum of forces in x and y. (take note if we have composite bdies, that we keep track of what elements we are working with. usually if we work with the )
