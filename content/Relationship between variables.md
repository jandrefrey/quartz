title: "Relationship between variables"

Data can correlate positively and negatively.

Variables can be dependant or independent. If two variables are not associated, then they are said to be independent. That is, two variables are independent if there is no evident relationship between the two.

We might compare the effect of one variable(explanatory) on another(response).
