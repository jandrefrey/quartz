# Second law of thermodynamics
Heat flows from hot to cold.

- **thermal energy reservoir**: A hypothetical body with a relatively large thermal energy capacity (mass x specific heat) that can supply or absorb finite amounts of heat without undergoing any change in temperature is called a thermal energy reservoir (ex. oceans, rivers, atmosphere)
	- Source: Reservoir that supplies energy
	- Sink: Reservoir that absorbs energy


## Kelvin-Plank Statement
> It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work.

No heat engine can have a thermal efficiency of 100 percent, or as for a power plant to operate, the working fluid must exchange heat with the environment as well as the furnace.

## Clasius Statement
It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no effect other than the transfer of heat from a lower temperature body to a higher temperature body.
