# Temperature
$T(K) = T(\degree C) +273.15$
$T(\degree F) = 1.8T(\degree C) + 32$
$\Delta T(K) = \Delta T(\degree C)$

## Thermodynamic Temperature scale
A temperature scale that is independent of the properties of the substances that are used to measure temperature is called a thermodynamic temperature scale. 
Such a temperature scale offers great conveniences in thermodynamic calculations.
