title: "Stability Margins"
---
We can use the Bode plot of the open-loop system to determine the stability of the closed loop system.

When the **Phase** of the open loop transfer function is **less than $180\degree$** the system is unstable.

Notice that the cross-over frequency is $22\degree$ away from where the phase is $-180\degree$.
$\frac 1 {GM} = 0.5$ as defined by how far the $-180\degree$ intersect is from the cross-over frequency.

## Phase Margin
Specify system performance/response.
$$\zeta = \frac{PM}{100}$$
while $PM<70\degree$ in 2nd order systems.
