# Heat energy
### [[Energy]] transfer by heat
- Heat transfer per unit mass [kJ/kg]
	- $q = \frac Q m$
- $Q = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}{\dot{Q}}{dt}$
	- $= \dot{Q}\Delta t$ for constant rate

#### Types of heat transfer
- Conduction: Interactions between molcules of subsatences
- Convection: Between solid surface and adjacent fluid in motion
- Radiation: emission of electromagnetic waves

## Latent heat of vaporisation
- $Q = mh_{fg}$
	- Liquid going to vapor has energy Q
use this for [[Carnot Cycle]]
