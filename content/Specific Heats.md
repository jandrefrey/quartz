# Specific Heats
The energy required to raise the temperature of the unit mass of a substance by one degree.

Although these values are known as constant volume and constant pressure specific heats, they can be used during **any process**

(For ideal gasses, $c_p$ and $c_v$ vary with temperature only)
> $\Delta u = c_v \Delta T$

> $\Delta h = c_p \Delta T$

So when doing Energy balance, we can replace $\Delta u$ or $\Delta h$ with c

We have 3 ways to calculate these values:
1. Table A17 in text book
2. Table A-2c and ==integrate==
3. Using average specific heats

> $c_p - c_v = R$

- Specific heat ration 
	- $k = \frac{c_p}{c_v}$
