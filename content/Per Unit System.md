title: "Per Unit System"

$$\text{per-unit quantity}=\frac{\text{actual quantity}}{\text{base value quantity}}$$
It gives a comparison to the machine's rated values. (% of it's rated value).

The base value would then be the machine's rated value of interested.
Eg: $P_{base}=V_{base}I_{base}$

> The per unit value has the same phase angle as the original value.
## Transformers
Different regions of a system, that are separated by transformers:
- $S_{base}$ is the same
- $V_{base}$ changes with the turn's ratio

> There are two sets of base values of a transformer namely the base values on the primary side of the transformer and the base values on the secondary side of the transformer. If per unit values are calculated, either from primaryreferred values or from secondary-referred values, then exactly the same per unit values are obtained. The per unit circuit, thus, does not have things such as referred values.
