## A current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field around it.

**Magnetic field intensity** produced by current $i$: [Ampere-turns per meter] $$H = \frac{Ni}{l_c}$$ 
where $N$ is number of windings, and $l_c$ is the length of the core. $H$ can be seen as the effort that the current is making to produce the magnetic field. Combining $H$ with material properties yields the **magnetic flux density:** [Webers per $m^2$ or Teslas]
$$B=\mu H$$  where $\mu$ is the **magnetic permeability** of the material. [Henrys per meter]
	Permeability of free space: $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} H/m$
	Any other material is compared to air with relative permeability: $\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0}$
The **Total magnetic flux** is given by: $$\Phi = BA$$
$A$ is the cross-sectional area of the core (perpendicular to the flux vector.)

**Magnetomotive force** (mmf): [Ampere-turns] 
$$\begin{align}\mathcal{F} &=\phi \mathcal{R} \\
&= Ni
\end{align}$$
Determining direction with Right Hand Rule. Fingers curl in direction of current flow and thumb in direction of positive force.
- Reluctance of circuit: $\mathcal{R}=\frac{l_c}{\mu A}$[ampere-turns per weber]
	- Reluctance adds the same as resistance in series vs parallel.
## magnetic field induces a voltage in a coil of wire if it passes through that coil.
Voltage induced in coil:
$$e_{ind} = N \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$
Number of coil turns $N$ and flux passing through coil $\phi$

## A current-carrying wire near a magnetic field has a force induced on it.
$$F = ilB$$
- $i$ = current in wire
- $l =$ length of wire
- $B=$ magnetic flux density vector
- Note that the original equation is given as a vector so if not perpendicular, use sin() of F

## A moving wire near a magnetic field has a voltage induced on it.
$$e_{ind} = vBl$$
- $v$ = velocity of wire
- $l =$ length of wire
- $B=$ magnetic flux density vector
- Note that the original equation is given as a vector so if not perpendicular, use sin() of F
