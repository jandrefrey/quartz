## Vapor Cycle
## Carnot Vapor Cycle

This is not practicle:
- Process 1-2 Limiting the maximum temperature of 374Â°C
- Process 2-3 The turbine cannot handle steam with a high moisture content.
- Process 4-1 It is not practical to design a compressor that handles two phases.

## Rankine Cycle
Impracticalities associated with the Carnot cycle can be eliminated by superheating the steam in the boiler and condensing it completely in the condenser.

- similar to Brayton:
	- heat input and output at constant pressure
	- for ideal cycle, isentropic

try and use v(p2-p1) istead of constant entropy for the pump, as the sompressed liquid tables in book is bad.

### Non-deal Rankine

### Rankine with reheat

### Rankine with Regen
Try to increase avg T during heat input to increase thermal efficiency.

Ideal:

#### Feedwater heater
we use feedwater heaters. we extract steam from an intermediate part of the turbine and transfer its heat to water leaving the pump.
  
- Closed FWH
	heat exchanger between extraction steam and the water. Do not mix

h4=h9=h5 (mixing chamber)????
- Open FWH
	mix together extraction steam and water.

	note that $\dot m$ between 5 and 6 < 6 and 7
	So this effects our [[Efficiency]] and also all other calcs.
