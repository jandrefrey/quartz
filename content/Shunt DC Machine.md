title: "Shunt DC Machine"
---
The field circuit is connected in shunt / parallel with the armature circuit

----
The voltage buildup during starting of the Shunt [[DC Generator]] occurs due to the remanent or residual magnetic flux in the core of the machine.
Due to the field weakening effects, the voltage regulation is worse

The terminal voltage of the shunt generator can be controlled by;
- Changing the speed of rotation
- Changing the field resistance and thus the field current (principle method)
