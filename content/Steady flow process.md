# Steady flow Process
A [[Processes]] during which ==Mass in the control volume is constant.==
Therefore from [[Conservation of mass]]:
- $\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t} = 0$
	and then
	- $\sum \dot{m}_{in} = \sum \dot{m}_{out}$
	- $\sum \rho VA_{in} = \sum \rho VA_{out}$

and from [[First law of thermodynmics]]:
- $\sum \dot{E}_{in} = \sum \dot{E}_{out}$
	So KE and PE and U are gonna be 0?

	- Then from [[Energy of flowing fluid]]
	1. ![[Pasted image 20220320225132.png]]
	2. ![[Pasted image 20220320225241.png]]
		and by [[Conservation of mass]]:
	3. 1 inlet, 1 outlet

And we use this for
1. [[nozzles and diffusers]]
2. [[turbines and compressors]]
3. fans and pumps
4. [[throttling valves]]
5. [[mixing chambers]] 
6. [[heat exchangers]]
7. [[Pipes and duct flows]]
