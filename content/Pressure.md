# Pressure
A normal force per unit area

$1Pa = 1 \frac N {m^2}$

## Gage pressure
- $P_{gage} = P_{abs} - P_{atm}$

## Manometer
- $P_2 = P_{atm} + \rho g h$
	- (note this yields Pa)!
	- where \rho is [[Mass#^a253a4||density]]
	- ==they can also give us SG==
	- going down, pressure increases. Going up, presure decreases.
