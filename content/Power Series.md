$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n(x-a)^n$$
Here, $c_n$ and $a$ are constants.

Converting functions to power series:
1. Convert the function to the form $\frac{a}{1-r}$
2. Write down the Geometric Series format $a r^n$ with $a \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}$ in front
3. Find the value for $𝒄_𝒏$ by grouping the 𝒙-functions
