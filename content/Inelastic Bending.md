As moment increases, we have 3 states

Condisitions For bending in beams:

And we assume

## Elastic behaviour
M_{applied} \leq M_Y
![[Pasted image 20220421153613.png]]

## Partially plastic
M_Y < M_{applied} <M_P

Where the plastic core starts at extreme fibres

	So for a partially plastic, rectangular cross-section

## Fully plastic
![[Pasted image 20220421153927.png]]
M_{applied} = M_P
so for plastic rectangular:

## Form Factor
$k=\frac{M_P}{M_Y}$

## Solution steps
![[Pasted image 20220421155019.png]]
we will obtain 2 yield moments, and we use the smallest one.

Since the section is not symmetric with the Horizontal axis, we need to find the Plastic NA. to find the Plastic NA, we need to assume that stress distribution produce a zero resultant force  on the cross section. So let's assume the plastic na is in the web of the t-beam,  and if the answer is negative, our assumption was wrong.

bc d<0.12, our assumption was correct.

where dc is ybar of area above plastic na
and dt is ybar of area below plastic na
