## Refrigerator

Because [[Second law of thermodynamics]], The transfer of heat from a low temperature medium to a high temperature medium requires special devices called **refrigerators.** here we look at [[Carnot Cycle]] Refrigerators

> The working fluid used in the refrigeration cycle is called a **refrigerant.**

## Heat Pumps
Heat pumps also transfer heat from low temp to high temp, but they use the warm air to heat something, instead of spitting it out.

- Most existing heat pumps use the cold outside air as the heat source in winter (air-source HP). 
	- In cold climates their efficiency drops considerably when temperatures are below the freezing point. In such cases, geothermal (ground-source) HP that use the ground as the heat source can be used.
- Air conditioners are basically refrigerators whose refrigerated space is a room or a building instead of the food compartment.
- from clasius statement, a refrigerator cannot operate unless its compressor is driven by an external power source, such as an electric motor. This way, the net effect on the surroundings involves the consumption of some energy in the form of work, in addition to the transfer of heat from a colder body to a warmer one.
