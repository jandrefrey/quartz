# Power Cycle
## Ideal cycle
The ideal cycle is made up of internally reversible processes. It allows us to analyse cycles.
Ideal cycles are internally reversible, bu tunlike the [[Carnot Cycle]] they are not nexessarily externally rev.

1. No friction involved. Hence, no pressure drop as it flows in pipes or devices such as heat exchangers
2. All expansion and compression processes take place in a quasiequilibrium manner
3. Perfect insulation of connecting pipes

## Air-standard assumptions
Air-standard cycle: A cycle for which the following assumptions are applicable.

- The working fluid is air, which continuously circulates in a closed loop and always behaves as an **ideal gas**.
	- The ideal gas 'area' is far from the vapor region, so don't draw a vapor curve.
- All the processes that make up the cycle are **internally reversible**.
- The combustion process is replaced by a heat-addition process from an external source.
- The exhaust process is replaced by a heat-rejection process that restores the working fluid to its initial state

**Cold-air-standard assumptions:** When the working fluid is considered to be air with constant specific heats at room temperature (25Â°C)

## Solving steps
1. 1st law around cycle
	1. Often times it is $W_{out}=Q_{in}-Q_{out}$
2. Then do 1st law for each process
	1. Find missing variables
