### Homogeneous Equation
This is type of [[Differential equations]]
A homogeneous function $f(x,y)$ of degree $\alpha$ satisfies the property:
$f(tx, ty) = t^\alpha f(x,y)$

Ex: (degree 2)
$$
\begin{flalign} 
f(x,y) & = xy + x^2 \\  
f(tx, ty) & = (tx)(ty) + (tx)^2 \\
& = t^2xy + t^2x^2 \\
& = t^2[xy + x^2] \\
& = t^2 f(x,y)
\end{flalign}
$$
- A DE of form $Mdx +Ndy=0$ is homogeneous of $M$ and $N$ are homogeneous of the same degree
- To solve a Homogeneous equation: ==substitute== $y=ux$ or $x=uy$
