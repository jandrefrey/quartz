- Different plots to view data:
	- A Scatterplot can provide a view of 2 numerical variables. 
	- A Dot plot can provide a view of a single numerical variable. 
	- Histograms are useful for large data sets, where data is grouped into bins. (Histograms help show the shape of data distribution)
	- Box Plot:

- Mean (Average) is a measure of the centre of the distribution.
	- $\bar x = \frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}$
- Data can be ==symmetric==, ==skewed to the right== (tail to the right), ==skewed to the left== (tail to the left).
