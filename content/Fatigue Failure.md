title: "Fatigue Failure"
---
Fatigue strength (lower than Yield strength) occurs due to cyclic loading over time.
1. Initiation of micro-crack due to cyclic plastic deformation
2. Progresses to macro-crack that repeatedly opens and closes, creating bands called beach marks
3. Crack has propagated far enough that remaining material is insufficient to carry the load, and fails by **simple ultimate failure**. (Area is effectively reduced)

These material characteristics are not necessarily defects. Micro-cracks(Dendrites) from nucleation point during solidification are to be expected.

### Rapid fracture (stage 3)
Using Static failure cirterion:
$$K_1=\beta\sigma\sqrt{\pi a}$$
$K_1$ is the Critical Stress Intensity Factor
$\beta$ and $a$ describe Flaw size, shape and orientation
$\sigma$ is known loading condition
  
## Stress-life method
This method predicts life in number of cycles.
$1<N<10^3$ low cycle fatigue
$10^3<N<10^6$ high cycle fatigue
$N>10^6$ is the endurance limit/**fatigue strength**
