plausible range of values where we are likely to find the population parameter

>In a normal distribution, 95% of the data is within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.

When the distribution of a point estimate qualifies for the Central Limit Theorem and therefore closely follows a normal distribution, we can construct a confidence interval as
$$\begin{aligned} & \text { point estimate } \pm z^* \times S E \\ & \hat{p} \pm z^* \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\end{aligned}$$
where $z^*$ = 
	1.96 for $95\%$ confidence
	2.58 for $99\%$ confidence

For proportions this is $\bar{x} \pm Z^{\star} \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$.

- ==margin of error==: distance required to travel in either direction away from the point estimate when constructing a confidence interval, ($z^* \times SE$)
- The higher the confidence, the wider the interval.
