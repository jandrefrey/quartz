title: "Frequency response"
---
The **Frequency response** is characterised by the steady state response
## System response to sinusoidal input
$$u(t) = Asin(\omega t)$$
We expect the output to also be sinusoidal:
$$y(t) = (A\times M) sin(\omega t + \phi)$$
With Gain:
$$M = |G(s)|_{s=j\omega}$$
And Phase Shift:
$$\phi = \angle G(s)_{s=j\omega}$$

## Bode Plot
Plot of the amplification and phase shift effect in a system output to sinusoidal inputs for a wide range of frequencies. (Note that the frequency is on a **log scale**)

1. Expand transfer function into simpler transfer functions.
2. Get expression for amplification and phase shift plot of simple transfer functions.
3. Plot individual transfer function Bode plots.
4. Super-impose to determine system Bode plot.
