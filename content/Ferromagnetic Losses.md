## Core Losses

- Electrical or copper or I 2R losses
- Brush losses
- Core losses
	- Eddy current losses
	- Hysteresis Losses
- Mechanical losses
- Stray or miscellaneous losses

The power converted from electrical to mechanical power, is also sometimes called the developed power: $P_{conv} = \tau_{ind}\omega m$
Is the same as the power associated with back-EMF and armature current 
$P_{conv} = E_AI_A$
