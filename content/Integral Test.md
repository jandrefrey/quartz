title: "Integral Test"
---
1. Confirm that the series is Continuous, Positive and decreasing
2. Change (can only be done if the function is continuous, positive, descending.)
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \text { to } \lim _{b \rightarrow \infty} \int_1^b
$$
3. Determine the integral
4. Calculate the limit
5. ==If the limit exists - series is CONVERGENT==
6. If the limit does not exist - series is DIVERGENT

use le'hopital if 0/0
if $\frac {cos}{e^k}$ , by squeeze theorem = 0
