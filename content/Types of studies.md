## Observational Studies
- Studies can be ==observational==, where there is no interference to the situation, effects are simply observed.  Making causal conclusions based on observational data can be treacherous and is not recommended. Thus, observational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations or form hypotheses that we later check using experiments.
	- Observational studies come in two forms: ==prospective and retrospective studies.== A prospective study identify individuals and collects information as events unfold. Some data sets may contain both prospectively- and retrospectively-collected variables.

## Experimental Studies
Experimental studies involve direct interference from the researchers.
- Controlling - researchers strive to control variables where possible
- Randomization - randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled
- Replication - Replicate entire study or collect sufficiently large sample(in a single study)
- Blocking - Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. Under these circumstances, they may first group individuals based on this variable into blocks and then randomize cases within each block to the treatment groups.
