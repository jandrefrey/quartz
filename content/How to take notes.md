- So keep notes as atomic as possible

- So we don't make notes sequantially, but rather conceptually.
Group (for example) all stress notes together and all strain notes together.

- Don't rewrite wikipedia, focus on what is important, ==conceptually==.

- And then we can link small paragraphs to a semester's module page and build an index


## New idea
Ipad notes in classes, as fast and rough as possible
Then when we have time, we do it on obsidian, as mentioned above.
