title: "Uncertainty"
---
Uncertainty implies that you need to reduce the maximum allowable load (torque) from the ideal loss of function load to a LOWER (allowable) value based on the uncertainty.
- Deterministic method: **design factor** (greater than 1):$$n_d=\frac{\text { ideal loss of function load (strength) }}{\text { maximum allowable load }}=\frac{S}{\sigma}$$
	- $n_d = 1 \rightarrow$ no uncertainty
	-  $n_d > 1 \rightarrow$ uncertainty (reducing capacity)

- If $n_d$ is given: $$load_{max, allowable} = \frac{strength}{n_d}$$

Commonly load is not a good factor to use, so strength and stress is used.
