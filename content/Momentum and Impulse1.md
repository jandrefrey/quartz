# Momentum And Impulse
Use when we have problems over time or instantaneous, and $𝐹(𝑡)$ or $𝑀(𝑡)$ is given
## Momentum
### [[General Plane Motion]]
Linear momentum is given by:

Angular momentum:

where mv is used for a point away from G

### [[Translation]]
The linear momentum is

and the angular momentum:

## Principle of Impulse and Momentum
### Linear
![[Pasted image 20220507175934.png]]
We can split F and v into x and y components, and solve accordingly.
### Angular

## Conservation of Momentum
For Zero impulse:

The same is true for angular momentum.
