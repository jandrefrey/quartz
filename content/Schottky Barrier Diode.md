title: "Schottky Barrier Diode"
---
Fabricated by joining a metal with a moderately doped n-type semiconductor. (No p-type). However the current-voltage relationship is similar to that of a pn-junction.

Note that the **turn-on voltage** is lower for a Schottky diode.

Useful for switching circuits since it often has negligible capacitance.
