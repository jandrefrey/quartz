## From [[General Plane Motion]]

## Steps:
1. Diagram
	1. Coordinate system
	2. Forces
	3. moments
	4. Accelerations and velocities
2. [[Planar equations of motion]]
3. Kinematics (velocity, relative v, etc) or other equations for a specific question.
	1. if something is not on the verge of slipping, friction is not u_sN (max static friction)
	2. if something is slipping, friction is u_kN
	3. often with these equations where we formulate a interms of the forces, we will have constant acceleration so CHECK
	4.
