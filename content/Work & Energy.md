# Work & Energy
Use if we have problems over distance or angle, and $F(s)$ or $M(\theta)$ is given.

## Potential Energy
### Due to gravity
1. Choose Datum.
2. $V_G=mgy_G$

### Due to Spring
$V_e = +\frac 1 2 ks^2$


## Work of a force
![[Pasted image 20220425111601.png]]
### For a constant force
![[Pasted image 20220425111625.png]]
If the force is acting in the direction of travel, use Fs
### For a weight

### For a spring force
![[Pasted image 20220425111713.png]]
Signs depend on direction of travel

- Only kinetic friction does work, so no slip means no work
### Work of a couple moment

## Principle of work and energy
$T_1+U_{1-2} = T_2$

$T_1+V_{g1}+V_{e1}+(U_{1-2})_{noncons}=T_2+V_{g2}+V_{e2}$

## Conservation of Energy
Only conservative forces, $U=0$ 
$T_1+V_1=T_2+V_2$

### Conservative Forces
The work is independent of the path
