# Carnot Cycle
This is a cycle that uses only [[Processes#Irreversible processes|irreversible processes]]. It is thus the most effecient cycle.
So if they want "ideal, max, min, etc" then we know it is reversible/carnot

where (s) is [[Entropy]]

## Reversed Carnot cycle

## Carnot Principles
1. The [[Efficiency]] of an irreversible heat engine is always less than the efficiency of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs.
2. The efficiencies of all reversible heat engines operating between the same two reservoirs are the same

## Carnot [[Refrigerators and heat pumps]] 
![[Pasted image 20220412114021.png]]
- The [[Efficiency#COP of Carnot Cycle Carnot Refrigerators and heat pumps Carnot refrigerators and heat pumps|COP]] of a reversible refrigerator or heat pump is the maximum theoretical value for the specified temperature limits. 
- **Actual refrigerators or heat pumps may approach these values as their designs are improved, but they can never reach them.**
- The COPs of both the refrigerators and the heat pumps decrease as TL decreases. That is, it requires more work to absorb heat from lowertemperature media.
