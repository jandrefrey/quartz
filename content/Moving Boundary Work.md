# Moving Boundary Work
Work done by movng boundary

- $W_b = \int P dV$
	- + for expansion
	- - for compression

## Constant volume [[Processes]]
$W_b = 0$

## [[Processes#^7bb744|Constant pressure process]]
$W_b = P(\Delta V)$

## Isothermal compression [[Processes]]
$W_b = P_1 V_1 ln \frac{V_2}{V_1}$

## Polytropic [[Processes]]
$W_b = \frac{P_2 V_2- P_1 V_1}{1-n}$
$= \frac{mR(T_2-T_1)}{1-n}$ for ideal gas

## Expansion against a spring

Steps:
1. change in height: $x = \frac {\Delta V} A$
2. $F_{spring} = ks$
3. $P_{spring} = \frac F A$
4. $P_{total} = P_{spring} + P_{constant}$
5. $W_{total} = W_{spring} + W_{constant} =\int P dV$
6. We can use area under function:
