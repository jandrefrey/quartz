# Mass
Mass is measured in $kg$ .

## Weight
From mass we can find weight
- $F_g = mg$

### Specific weight 
weight of unit volume of a substance
- $\gamma = \rho g$

## Density

^a253a4

$\rho = \frac m V$

## Specific gravity
The ratio of density of a substance to the density of some standard substance at a specific temperature (usually water at $4 \degree C$)
- $SG = \frac {\rho }{\rho_{H_20}}$

### Mass flow rate
in [kg/s]
$$
\begin{align}
\dot{m} &= \frac{m}{t} \\
&=\int \rho V dA \\
&= \rho VA
\end{align}
$$

but from [[Volumetric flow rate]]

$$
\begin{align}
\dot{m} &= \rho \dot{V}
\\ &= \rho A_c \bar{V}_{avg}
\end{align}
$$

Mass flow leads to [[Energy]] flow
