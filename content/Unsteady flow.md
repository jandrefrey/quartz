# Unsteady flow
Mass and energy of the control volume changes with time

- Charging and recharging of rigid vessels
- pressure cooker
- using pressurised air to drive fluid

- From [[Conservation of mass]] and [[First law of thermodynmics]] we still have:

- So we can't use our "shortcuts" anymore, so now (from [[Energy of flowing fluid]])

		- (use h if constant P(rigid tank) and u if not constant P)


- if $KE$ and $PE$ is constant
