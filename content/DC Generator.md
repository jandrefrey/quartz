title: "DC Generator"
---
For DC motor, speed regulation is important, but for a DC generator (similar to a transformer) voltage regulation (VR) is important:
$$\mathrm{VR}=\frac{V_{\mathrm{nl}}-V_{\mathrm{fl}}}{V_{\mathrm{fl}}} \times 100 \%$$

- nl = no-load
- fl = full-load

Different types:
- [[Separately excited DC Machine]]
- [[Shunt DC Machine]]
- [[Permanent-Magnet DC Machine]]
- [[Series DC Machine]]
- [[Compound DC Machine]]
