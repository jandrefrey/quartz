# bending Stresses in composite beams
#SM224
- homogeneous material
- Assume no slip between composite materials
- The cross section remains plane and perp. to the NA
- the normal strains vary linearly from zero at the NA to a maximum value at the extreme fibres

Assume elements 1 and 2 are linear elastic

Note the jump in tension between the 2 materials, even though the strain is the same (it is bc the stiffness of the materials are different)

We choose to look at 1 material as our base. then it will widen under strain

And the force acting on the element:

## Solution steps
1. pick 1 material as base
2. $n=\frac{E_{weak}}{E_{base}}$
3. Note only the width gets transformed, not the height
4. Use the transformed sections to determine $\bar y$ and $I_{NA}$
		1. new width = $n \times$ old width
5. Determine stresses for base material at the inner and outer edge (normal way)
6. Determine stresses of 'weaker material'. and $\times n$
