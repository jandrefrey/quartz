# Stress concentrations
#SM224
When an axial force is applied to a shaft that contains fillets and holes, torsion to a shift with fillets, moment to a shaft with notches.

## Axial force
So instead of determining max stress, we'll determine average stress, and use the stress concentration factor to find the max stress.

- Stress concertation factor:

	- For axial members find K from a graph using r/h and w/h (see below) 
	- $\sigma_{avg} = \frac N A$ where A is the smallest cross-sectional area at the position of the cut
	- $\sigma_{max} = K \times \sigma_{avg}$

## [[Torsion]]
We cannot use $\tau_{max} = \frac{Tc}{J}$ if we have a sudden change in cross-section
Here we use Torque stress concentration, K, similar as above.
