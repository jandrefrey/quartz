- When a photon hits the cell, it is absorbed by the semiconductor material (typically silicon).
- This only occurs if the photon energy is greater than the bandgap energy.
- Otherwise, the photon will be reflected, or will pass through the silicon.
- The absorbed photon passes energy to an electron in the depletion region. An electron-hole pair is formed.
- Electrons will flow through the load and a DC current is measured.
