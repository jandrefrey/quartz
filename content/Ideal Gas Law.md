# Ideal Gas Law

Ideal gas equation: 
- $Pv = RT$
	- $T$ is [[temperature]] in kelvin
	$R$ is specific gas constant
	**specific** volume $v=\frac V m$

> Water Vapor is ideal below 10kPa

- Ideal gas at 2 states:
	$\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$


## Compressibility factor
measure of deviation from ideal gas behavior

1. Find $P_R =\frac{P}{P_{cr}}$
	1. $P_{cr}$ from tables
2. Find $T_R =\frac{T}{T_{cr}}$
	1. $T_{cr}$ from tables
3. Use compressibilty chart to find Z.

- $Pv = ZRT$
	- Ideal gas: $Z=1$
	- +/-0.05 is fine
