While we have loading within the elastic region, we can use principle of superposition, but when plastic, we can't.

- Procedure
	- We can take a cut at the required section and look at the reaction forces and moments.
	- Then we can convert them to stresses with the equations above.
	- Then we can add/subtract (compression/tension) our stresses.
	- And then we can determine our requirements.
