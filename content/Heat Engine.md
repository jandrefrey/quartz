# Heat Engine
Device that converts heat to work. Because of [[Second law of thermodynamics]], work naturally converts to heat, but a Heat Engine works the other way around.
1. Receive heat from a high-temperature source (solar energy, oil furnace, nuclear reactor, etc.).
2. Convert part of this heat to work (usually in the form of a rotating shaft.)
3. Reject the remaining waste heat to a low-temperature sink (the atmosphere, rivers, etc.).
4. Operate on a cycle.

> **working fluid**: Heat engines and other cyclic devices usually involve a fluid to and from which heat is transferred while undergoing a cycle.

## Energy balance
For a cycle: $Q_{in} + W_{in} - Q_{out} + W_{out} = 0$
So here: $Q_{in} - Q_{out} = W_{net}$ (also for rates)
Here we can see that $Q_{in} > W_{net}$
