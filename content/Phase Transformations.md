# Phase Transformations
Reactions that cause microstructure of material to change.
These reactions are time-dependant, described by Avrami's equation:

- $y=1-e^{-kt^n}$
	- rate = $\frac{1}{T_{0.5}}$

## Congruent phase transformation
no change in composition
### [[Recrystallisation]]

Developing strains from material that was previously cold worked by heating.
Reaction rate much larger above Recrystallization temp $T_R$

So we have cold work and then t time later, recrystallization occurs and then some longer time later grain growth.

## Incongruent Phase Transformation
### [[Eutectoid]] Phase Transformation

So now we have a increase in reaction rate for a decrease in temp. (at lower temp, further away from eutectoid line, the driving force to neutralise the perlite is much larger.)

Quenching - rapidly cooling
We quench and down to a temp(vert down) and then keep in there(horiz right) .

## Continuous Cooling Diagram (CCT)
Transformations are delayed as in reality. Thus curve moves to the right.
