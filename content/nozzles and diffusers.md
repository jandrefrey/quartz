# Nozzles and Diffusers

These are [[Steady flow process]]
By changing the corss-sectional Area:

- nozzle
increases velocity, decreases pressure

- diffuser
decreases velocity, increases pressure

In general (unless the problem states otherwise)
$gz = 0$
$\dot {W} = 0$
$\dot {Q} = 0$

so we're left with:
